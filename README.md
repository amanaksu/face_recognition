# 1. Image classification with Custom Dataset

Dedicated for those who are sick and tired of MNIST. 

In this examples, we will be using [labeled faces in the wild (LFW)](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/).

Subset of LFW dataset can be found in [here](https://github.com/sjchoi86/img_dataset).  
(Please let me know if there are any problems regarding uploading images to the GitHub.)

# 2. Introduction to CNNs 

Gentle introduction to Convolution, Strides, and Zero-padding. 

Brief description of AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet. 

# 3. Computer Vision Applications 

1. Semantic Segmantation (Fully Conv. Net, DeConvNet, and DeepLab with Atrous Convolution)
2. Object Detection Algorithms (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, SPP-net, and Faster R-CNN)
